    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "City Walking Tour Planner is aiming to generate a simple recommendation for a walking trip in a city from a given start point (location address or coordinates) to a given end point. \n",
    "\n",
    "The recommendation starts with a good rated Cafe, and it offers the user a list of Wiki introduction, photo and homepage for the places to visit with the tour. With some hardcoded values like walking speed, number of hours to spend for each category, it arranges the time and places for lunch. Then places to visit for the afternoon and dinner. Eventually it guides you to your end point, which could also be your start point. \n",
    "\n",
    "The recommendation will be presented on the Folium Map, and each places will be marked with the sequence number. Followed by the map, each places will be introduced with the information, picture, rating, tip from Foursquare if it has any and accessible with my free subscription. \n",
    "\n",
    "The background is to offer recommendation for the travelers, who enjoys walking around and need a reference to look at when planning a tour. With most of the navigation service, one can easily find things to do and places to visit, but most of them are still in the level of returning different venues for the user to select, not so many service provide recommendations  for trip planning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Future vision: As a traveler, given my data of my tips, places visited, places liked/disliked, one service shall be possible to be trained to offer recommendations of the places I might interested. Therefore, when I am planning a trip in a new city, the service shall give me different route options, with estimated hours, estimated walking distance, highlights of the route, and a list of places to visit. In addition, peak hours, open hours are to be considered when making a route recommendation.\n"
